    <h2> Description</h2>
    <p>Gordon Ramsay's scrambled egg recipe</p>

    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>Bread of choosing</li>
        <li>3 eggs</li>
        <li>½ tbsp. butter (Although if this confuses you it's around 7 grams or half a tbsp.)</li>
        <li>½ tsp. crème fraîche</li>
        <li>Salt and pepper to taste</li>
        <li>As many chives on top as desired (I recommend a lot)</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Put bread in the toaster and start to cook eggs while toast is toasting..</li>
        <li>Cut chives and place them off to the side.</li>
        <li>The egg process typically takes around 3 minutes on a high heat, and has to be done quickly. First, take a
            deep
            saucepan and turn your stove onto a high heat. Crack all of your eggs directly into the pan, and place knobs
            of
            butter in, making sure to stir continuously. Stir for 30 seconds while on the heat, and then take it off,
            making
            sure to stir continuously even when it is off the heat.</li>
        <li>Continue this off-and-on process until your eggs seem to thicken a little bit. You don't want them to
            thicken
            too much though, as the end result is creamy, not in chunks.</li>
        <li>Once slightly thicker, stir in the crème fraîche. When it reaches your desired consistency, season to taste
            with
            salt and pepper and plate on top of toast with your cut up chives.</li>
    </ol>
