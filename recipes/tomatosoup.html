<h2> Description</h2>
<p>Gordon Ramsay Creamy Roasted Tomato Soup</p>

<h2>Ingredients</h2>
<ul>
    <li>3 -1/2 lb. Vine Tomatoes of ripe tomatoes that are cored and halved</li>
    <li>2 Med Red Onions (peeled and chopped)</li>
    <li>2 Cloves Garlic (peeled and finely sliced)</li>
    <li>Ex Virgin Olive Oil</li>
    <li>Fresh Sea Salt to taste</li>
    <li>Ground Pepper to taste</li>
    <li>1 tsp. Cayenne Pepper</li>
    <li>1 tsp. Brown Sugar</li>
    <li>1 qt. Vegetable Stock</li>
    <li>4 oz. Heavy whipping cream</li>
</ul>
<h2>Steps</h2>
<ol>
    <li>Preheat the oven to 350 degrees.</li>
    <li>On medium heat, place a roasting tray on the hob. Add the garlic, onions, and cayenne pepper first. Make sure
        your onions are well coated with olive oil, and cook for 5 minutes. A pinch of salt and pepper, brown sugar, and
        balsamic vinegar should be added to the tomatoes that have been cored and halved. Stir it well and bake for 25
        minutes. Continue cooking the tomatoes for another 5 minutes or until they begin caramelizing.</li>
    <li>Remove the roasting tin from the oven after 25 minutes and place it back on the back burner at medium heat. Add
        the vegetable stock and heat until boiling, then simmer for a few minutes. Stir in the double cream and simmer
        for two more minutes.</li>
    <li>If you prefer a chunky rustic soup, you can use a potato masher to 'blend' your soup to a thick consistency. The
        flavors will all mix in your soup rather than if you blend it. Using a stick blender straight in the pan can
        achieve a traditional cream blend.</li>
</ol>
